    <h1>Fitness Meta of Homo Sapiens</h1>
    <p><em>January 16, 2026</em></p>

    <p>Fitness. To most people it just means not being fat and sloppy. But when someone says “his fitness is trash,” we all know what they mean — that is “he’s out of shape, weak, slow”. When they say “his fitness is elite,” we picture an athlete who crushes everything.</p>

    <p>These days, when normal people hear “fitness,” their brain instantly goes to the jacked guy (or girl) in the gym, squatting, curling, benching, lifting weights. Gym culture is everywhere now even in developing countries. Everyone knows what a gym is. Want to get fit? Most people think: sign up for a gym, lift weights, get big muscles. That’s the default thinking.</p>

    <p>I’ve been reading <strong>The Beginning of Infinity</strong> by David Deutsch lately, and it hit me hard. The whole point is that we humans are always at the beginning. No matter how much we know in 100 years, 10,000 years, a million years, we’re still closer to zero than to infinity. We’ll never finish physics. Never fully master biology. And the same goes for physical fitness. There is no final, absolute version of fit. What we think is peak right now will look primitive later as knowledge grows. Genetic engineering might let us live up to 1000 years, then we’ll have to figure out the fitness of a 1000-year-old body with totally different physiology. The fitness industry loves to sell absolutes like “this is THE way to train” but nah. It’s all temporary truth. Progress never stops.</p>

    <p>Right now, mainstream fitness is obsessed with building big skeletal muscles. Lift, eat and grow. And yeah it works for size and strength. But look closer: do most gym bros have real cardiovascular endurance? Usually not. Do they have crazy explosiveness? Not really. They’re strong, but not dynamic like a sprinter.</p>

    <p>Let’s talk muscle fibers for context</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1 (slow-twitch)</strong>: Built for endurance. They keep going forever with low power. Marathon runners live here, high percentage, crazy fatigue resistance. (everyone functions on type 1, i’m using this type as i’m writing this, this muscle fiber works constantly throughout the day in us)</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2A (fast-twitch oxidative)</strong>: The hybrid. Good power + decent endurance. It’s the hybrid of type 1 and type 2x.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2X (fast-twitch glycolytic)</strong>: Pure explosiveness. Max power, but tires super fast. Elite sprinters, jumpers, and guys like Messi when he explodes past defenders.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here’s the thing: heavy gym training (especially bodybuilding style) mostly targets Type 2A. It builds strength and size, no doubt. But it doesn’t max out pure explosiveness. And without dedicated cardio, it skips the deep endurance of Type 1.</p>

    <p>So the typical gym guy is strong and muscular… but he’s only specialized in one lane. Put him in a real-world test like, a decathlon, a tough soccer game, or even CrossFit and he often gets smoked by athletes who train all the systems: endurance base + hybrid power + explosive bursts.</p>

    <p>Mainstream fitness isn’t wrong. It’s just incomplete.</p>

    <p>It’s high time we wake up. Stop thinking “I go to the gym so I’m fit.” You might be strong. You might look good. But true all-round fitness? That means training everything from type1, type 2a and type 2x. Build the engine that can endure, explode, and recover. Break out from the typical gym person who doesn’t have endurance nor the explosiveness and just in the middle.</p>

    <p>We’re at the beginning of what fitness can be. Don’t settle for one slice. Train to become the complete Physical specimen of a human.</p>

    <p><strong>Rise up!!!</strong></p>
