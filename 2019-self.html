    <h1>I wrote this in 2019</h1>
    <p><em>Originally written in 2019 · Republished December 17, 2025</em></p>

    <p>I found this piece i wrote back in 2019:</p>
   
    <p>The most important relationship is the one you have with yourself — and most people don't have a good relationship with themselves.</p>

    <p>If you are like most people, then you better develop a better relationship with yourself. Because you can't break up with yourself like you do in other relationships. No matter what, you'll always be with yourself till the end.</p>

    <p>The first step is to love yourself. By that I mean truly loving yourself through actions. You can't just say "I love myself" and do nothing. You have to back it up with actions. Actions over intentions.</p>

    <p>There is a line I love from my favorite Batman movie: <blockquote>"It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you."</blockquote></p>

    <p>Underneath you might think you love yourself, but if you don't back it up with self-loving actions, then you don't really love yourself.</p>

    <p>Most people will say they love themselves and will act in self-destructive ways. If you are one of those people, then I'll give you this one piece of advice — through a book title by Kamal Ravikant: <strong>Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now go do that.</p>
